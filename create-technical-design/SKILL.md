# Technical Design Creator

Creates technical design documents that communicate architecture decisions, system structure, and key trade-offs. The output defines **what to build and how it is structured** — not how to execute the work step by step.

## Core Principle: Architecture Over Implementation

Before adding any detail, ask: "If we change frameworks or libraries, does this still apply?"

- YES → include it (architectural decision)
- NO → exclude it (implementation detail)

**Include**: API contracts, data schemas, component diagrams, technology choices with rationale, event/log schemas, integration boundaries.

**Exclude**: CLI commands, code snippets, framework-specific syntax, file paths, tool-specific configuration.

The technical design must survive implementation changes. If the team migrates ORMs or rewrites a service, the design doc should remain valid.

## Routing

- Define requirements → `/create-prd`
- Debate and decide options → `/create-rfc`
- Record a finalized decision → `/create-adr`
- Plan execution phases → `/create-implementation-plan`

## Document Sections

### Mandatory

If the user does not provide this information, ask using AskUserQuestion.

1. **Header & Metadata** — tech lead, team, epic/ticket link, status, dates
2. **Context** — current state, business domain, stakeholders (2–4 paragraphs)
3. **Problem Statement & Motivation** — specific problems with quantified impact, why now, cost of inaction
4. **Scope** — in-scope (V1/MVP, min 3 items), out-of-scope (min 3 items), future considerations (V2+)
5. **Technical Solution** — architecture overview with diagram (Mermaid), key components and responsibilities, data flow, API contracts, database changes
6. **Key Decisions & Trade-offs** — decisions made, alternatives rejected, rationale
7. **Risks** — min 3 risks with impact (H/M/L), probability (H/M/L), and mitigation

### Critical (required when applicable)

Determine applicability from project context. If applicable but missing, ask using AskUserQuestion.

| Section | Required When |
|---------|---------------|
| **Security Considerations** | Payments, auth, PII, external integrations |
| **Monitoring & Observability** | Production systems |

**Security**: auth/authz approach, encryption (at rest, in transit), PII handling and retention, compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI DSS), secrets management, webhook signature validation.

**Monitoring**: key metrics with alert thresholds, structured log format and what never to log (secrets, card numbers), alert severity and response actions.

### Suggested (offer based on project size)

After mandatory and critical sections, offer these. Skip most for small/simple projects; include all relevant ones for large/complex projects.

| Section | When Valuable |
|---------|---------------|
| **Alternatives Considered** | Multiple viable approaches existed |
| **Performance Requirements** | Latency/throughput/availability targets |
| **Dependencies** | External services, team dependencies, blockers |
| **Migration Plan** | Replacing existing systems |
| **Open Questions** | Unresolved decisions blocking implementation |
| **Success Metrics** | Business KPIs, adoption targets |
| **Glossary** | Domain-specific terminology |
| **Approval & Sign-off** | Requires stakeholder approval |

## Process

### Step 1: Check for Upstream Artifacts

Before gathering context, look for an existing PRD at `.specs/[feature-slug]/PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS.md`. If the feature slug is not yet known, ask for the feature name first and derive the slug.

- **PRD found**: Read it. Use it as the source of truth for requirements, scope, and problem statement. Skip asking for information already covered by the PRD.
- **PRD not found**: Proceed to gather context directly in Step 2.

### Step 2: Gather Context

Ask for:
- Project/feature name (if not already known from Step 1)
- Project type (new feature, integration, refactor/migration, etc.)
- Whether a clear problem statement exists or needs defining (skip if PRD was found)

### Step 3: Collect Mandatory Information

Ensure you have enough to write all mandatory sections. Ask for anything missing (skip fields already answered by the PRD):
- Tech lead and team members
- Problem with impact (what, why, quantified consequences)
- In-scope and out-of-scope items (min 3 each)
- High-level solution approach
- At least 3 risks

### Step 4: Determine Critical Sections

Based on project type, identify required critical sections:
- Payment/auth/PII projects: Security is mandatory
- Production systems: Monitoring is mandatory

### Step 5: Offer Suggested Sections

Based on project size, offer relevant suggested sections. Ask: "Would you like to include any of these sections?"

### Step 6: Generate and Validate

**File location**: `.specs/[feature-slug]/TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md` — derive the slug from the feature name (lowercase, hyphen-separated). Create the directory if it does not exist.

Generate using the template below. Validate against the checklist. Highlight any gaps in the output summary.

## Template

```markdown
# Technical Design — [Project/Feature Name]

| Field        | Value                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Tech Lead    | @Name                        |
| Team         | Name1, Name2, Name3          |
| Epic/Ticket  | [Link]                       |
| Status       | Draft / In Review / Approved |
| Created      | YYYY-MM-DD                   |
| Last Updated | YYYY-MM-DD                   |

## Context

2–4 paragraphs: current state, related system/feature, business domain, stakeholders.

## Problem Statement & Motivation

### Problems We're Solving

- **[Problem 1]**: [Pain point] — Impact: [Quantify]
- **[Problem 2]**: [Pain point] — Impact: [Quantify]

### Why Now?

- [Business, technical, or user driver]

### Cost of Inaction

- **Business**: [Revenue loss, competitive disadvantage]
- **Technical**: [Debt accumulation, system degradation]
- **Users**: [Poor experience, churn risk]

## Scope

### In Scope (V1)

- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]

### Out of Scope (V1)

- [Item 1] (deferred to V2)
- [Item 2] (not needed for MVP)
- [Item 3] (future enhancement)

### Future Considerations (V2+)

- [Item dependent on V1 validation]

## Technical Solution

### Architecture Overview

[High-level description of the solution]

**Key Components**:

- [Component B]: [responsibility]

**Architecture Diagram**:

### Data Flow
