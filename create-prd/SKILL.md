name: create-prd
description: Creates structured, explicit, and detailed Product Requirement Documents (PRDs). Use when the user says "create a PRD", "write a PRD", "create a PRD for X", "define the requirements for X", "write product requirements", or wants to plan what to build before implementation begins. Do NOT use for technical design, implementation plan, RFC, or ADR docs.

# PRD Creator 

**Goal:** produce a PRD that is precise, self-contained, and unambiguous. A reader should know exactly what to build and why without asking follow-up questions.

## PRD vs Technical Design

| Aspect | PRD | Technical Design |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Define what to build and why | Document architecture and system structure |
| **Audience** | Product team, engineering team | Engineering team |
| **Focus** | What are we building, for whom, and why? | How is the system structured? |
| **Output** | Feature requirements, user stories | Architecture + data models + API contracts |
| **Timing** | Before implementation, during planning | After requirements are defined |

Use PRD when you need to **define the product requirements**. Use a technical design when you need to document the **architecture and technical approach**.

## PRD vs RFC

| Aspect | PRD | RFC |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Purpose** | Define what to build and why | Propose + decide on significant change |
| **Audience** | Product team, engineering team | Broad stakeholders, leadership |
| **Focus** | What are we building, for whom, and why? | Should we do X? Which option? |
| **Output** | Feature requirements, user stories | Decision + rationale |
| **Timing** | After direction is decided | Before committing to a direction |

Use PRD when the direction is decided and you need to **define what to build**. Use RFC when the **decision itself** needs alignment.

## PRD vs ADR

| Aspect | PRD | ADR |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Purpose** | Define what to build and why | Record a finalized architectural decision |
| **Audience** | Product team, engineering team | Future engineers, architects |
| **Focus** | What are we building, for whom, and why? | Why did we choose X over Y? |
| **Output** | Feature requirements, user stories | Decision + consequences |
| **Timing** | Before implementation, during planning | After a significant decision is made |

Use PRD when you need to **define product requirements**. Use ADR when you need to **record why a decision was made** for future reference.

## Process

### Step 1 — Gather context

**Do not draft anything yet.**
 
Through an open-ended conversation, develop a complete understanding of the problem space before proceeding. The conversation should cover:

- Define the core problem from the user’s perspective, including the specific pain points it addresses and the consequences of leaving it unsolved.
- Identify all target users, including primary, secondary, and edge-case personas, and clearly differentiate their goals, constraints, and behaviors.
- Specify the measurable outcomes (quantitative and/or qualitative) that indicate the solution is successful post-implementation.
- Establish clear scope boundaries: what is included, what is explicitly excluded, and what is intentionally deferred, with justification for each.
- Document hard constraints (technical, legal, operational) and key assumptions; explicitly call out which assumptions would invalidate the solution if proven false.
- Enumerate all distinct user types and map each to their specific needs, use cases, and expected interactions with the system.
- Define behavior across edge conditions, including empty states, error states, onboarding/first-time use, and advanced/power-user scenarios.
- Clarify prioritization by distinguishing must-have requirements from nice-to-have enhancements, including the rationale behind each classification.
- Identify adjacent problem areas or extensions that are intentionally not addressed, and explain why they are out of scope for this iteration.
- Articulate clear failure conditions: what specific outcomes, gaps, or user/stakeholder reactions would indicate the solution was incorrectly designed or implemented.

**How to conduct the interview:**
- Ask focused questions. Group related questions together when it makes sense, but avoid overwhelming the user with too many at once.
- When an answer opens a new branch (edge case, persona variation, scope boundary), follow it to resolution before continuing.
- When a decision depends on a prior unresolved decision, surface the dependency and resolve the blocker first.
- Push back on vague answers. "It depends" is not an answer — ask what it depends on, then ask about each case.
- Keep going until you can state the full scope, requirements, and success criteria without needing to invent anything yourself.

**Additional rules for the interview:**
- Do not proceed until you can state all of the above without inventing anything.
- If the user cannot answer a question, record it as an open question in the PRD — do not invent an answer.
- When asking questions, use dedicated tools (e.g. AskUserQuestion) to present them clearly and consistently to the user.

**Before moving to Step 2, verify internally that you can answer all of the following without inventing anything:**
- What is the core problem from the user's perspective?
- Who are the users and what does each need?
- What does success look like, measurably?
- What is explicitly out of scope, and why?
- What are the hard constraints?

If any cannot be answered from what the user has said, continue the interview.

### Step 2 — Draft using the template

Follow the template below. Every section is required. Write "None." for sections with no content — do not omit them.

**File location:** Create the PRD to `.specs/[feature-slug]/PRD.md`. Derive the slug from the feature name: lowercase, words separated by hyphens (e.g. `user-onboarding`, `payment-refunds`). Create the directory if it does not exist. This keeps the PRD co-located with related documents (plans, specs) that will be added later for the same initiative.

### Step 3 — Review with the user

Present the draft. Ask:
- Are all non-goals captured?
- Is there anything missing or incorrect?
- Are the success criteria measurable as stated?

If the feedback surfaces new information, gaps, or contradictions, return to Step 1 and continue the interview before updating the draft. Repeat steps 1–3 until the PRD is complete and accurate.

Once the PRD is finalized, offer the natural next step:

```
PRD created at .specs/[feature-slug]/PRD.md

Suggested next steps:
- Run /create-technical-design to define the architecture
- Run /create-rfc if a significant decision still needs alignment
- Run /create-implementation-plan to jump straight to execution planning (skips technical design)
```

## PRD Template

```markdown
# [Feature or Product Name]

## Overview

3–5 sentences covering: what this is, the core problem it solves, and who it's for.
Do not describe implementation or internal mechanics.

## Problem Statement

**Problem:** Describe the gap between the current state and the desired state, from the user's perspective.

**Affected users:** Who has this problem? Be specific about role, context, and frequency.

**Impact:** What happens if this problem is not solved? Use data or evidence where available.

## Target Users

| User | Context | Primary Need |
|------|---------|--------------|
| [User type] | [When/where they encounter this] | [What they need to accomplish] |

Add one row per distinct user type. If the same user appears in multiple contexts, add a row for each.

## Goals & Success Criteria

2–5 entries maximum. Each must be falsifiable — something that can be verified as true or false after shipping.

| Goal | Success Criterion | How to Measure |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| [Goal] | [Specific, observable outcome] | [Metric or verification method] |

Reject vague criteria: "users are happy", "performance improves", "adoption grows". Write instead: "task completion rate ≥ 85%", "support tickets for X decrease by 30% within 60 days of launch".

## Scope

### In Scope

Discrete, verifiable capabilities this PRD covers.

- [Capability]

### Non-Goals

What this PRD explicitly does not address. If a reader could reasonably assume something is in scope, it must appear here with a reason.

- [Topic] — [why it's excluded]

## Requirements

Functional requirements only — what the system must do, not how it does it.

**Priority labels:**
- **P0** — launch blocker; must ship
- **P1** — high value; should ship
- **P2** — nice to have; revisit later

Group by user or workflow where it aids clarity.

### [Group name]

- **[P0|P1|P2]** `[PREFIX-NNN]` The system must/should [verb] [object] [condition or outcome].

**Rules for writing requirements:**
- Use "must" for P0 and P1; use "should" for P2.
- One requirement per bullet — no AND; split compound requirements.
- Each requirement is independently verifiable as pass/fail.
- No implementation details: no tech stack, no data store names, no protocol choices.
- State the user outcome, not the internal mechanism.
- Requirement IDs use a prefix derived from the feature slug, uppercased and shortened to 3–5 characters (e.g. feature `user-onboarding` → prefix `ONBD`; `payment-refunds` → `PAY`). IDs are sequential within the PRD: `ONBD-01`, `ONBD-02`.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

Hard limits that bound the solution. Non-negotiable.

- [Constraint]: [explanation]

### Assumptions

Things treated as true for this PRD. If an assumption is invalidated, the PRD must be revisited.

- [Assumption]: [what we believe and why]

## Open Questions

Unresolved questions that must be answered before or during implementation.

| Question | Why It Matters | Owner | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------|--------|
| [Question] | [Impact if unresolved] | [Person or team] | Open / Resolved |

Write "None." if there are no open questions.

## Additional Notes

Any relevant information that doesn't fit in the above sections but is important for context or future reference.
```

## Heuristics

### Include if any of the following are true

- It would change what gets built or how it is prioritized.
- Reasonable people could interpret it differently without explicit guidance.
- It defines a boundary between what is in scope and what is not.
- It is a constraint that eliminates valid solution approaches.
- It is an assumption that, if false, would invalidate the PRD.

### Exclude if any of the following are true

- It describes *how* to build something: architecture, tech stack, data models, API contracts, code.
- It can only be determined after implementation begins.
- It is a timeline, milestone, headcount, or team assignment.
- It requires a domain specialist to interpret — link to a separate spec instead.
- It duplicates content already present in another section.

### Requirement quality checklist

Before finalizing requirements, verify each one:

- [ ] Verifiable as pass/fail independently
- [ ] Does not contain "and" (split if so)
- [ ] Does not name a specific implementation technology
- [ ] States user outcome, not internal mechanism
- [ ] Priority label (P0/P1/P2) assigned

### Scope quality checklist

- [ ] Every non-goal includes a reason for exclusion
- [ ] Non-goals cover anything a reader might reasonably assume is in scope
- [ ] In-scope items are discrete and independently verifiable

## Common Mistakes

**Writing a solution as the problem**
Wrong: "We need a dashboard for order status."
Right: "Customers cannot determine the current status of their orders without contacting support."

**Vague success criteria**
Wrong: "Improve user engagement."
Right: "30-day active user retention increases from 42% to 55%."

**Requirements that embed implementation**
Wrong: "The system must store user preferences in a Redis cache."
Right: "The system must persist user preferences across sessions."

**Missing non-goals that readers will assume**
If you are building order tracking but not order editing, "order editing" must appear in non-goals — not just be absent from the in-scope list.

**Conflating constraints with requirements**
A constraint limits *how* you can solve the problem ("must comply with GDPR"). A requirement defines *what* the system must do ("must allow users to delete their account data"). Keep them separate.
